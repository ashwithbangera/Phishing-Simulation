# Phishing Attack Simulation & Detection

This repository contains a phishing attack simulation performed using GoPhish on Kali Linux.  
The project demonstrates how phishing attacks are conducted, how user interaction is tracked, and how such attacks can be detected and prevented.

⚠️ This project is created strictly for educational and awareness purposes only. No real users were targeted.

## Objective

- To understand phishing as a social engineering attack  
- To simulate a phishing campaign in a controlled lab environment  
- To analyze phishing behavior and identify red flags  
- To study phishing detection and prevention methods  

---

## Tools & Environment

- Operating System: Kali Linux  
- Tool Used: GoPhish  
- Browser: Firefox  

---

## Project Workflow

1. Installed and configured GoPhish on Kali Linux  
2. Created a phishing-style email template  
3. Designed a fake login landing page with credential capture enabled  
4. Added a test user (self-email only)  
5. Launched a phishing campaign  
6. Observed campaign status and results  
7. Simulated user interaction by manually accessing the phishing landing page  
8. Analyzed phishing indicators and prevention techniques

## Email Delivery Status

Email delivery resulted in an **Error** status due to SMTP restrictions and email provider security controls (such as Gmail blocking phishing attempts).

To validate the phishing simulation:
- The phishing landing page was accessed manually
- Dummy credentials were submitted
- GoPhish successfully captured and logged user interaction

This approach is acceptable for lab-based phishing simulations.

---

## Observations

- GoPhish successfully simulated a phishing environment  
- Credential capture functionality worked correctly  
- Email delivery may fail due to modern email security mechanisms  
- Phishing attacks can be demonstrated even without real email delivery  

---

## Phishing Red Flags Identified

- Urgent or suspicious messages  
- Generic greetings instead of personalized names  
- Unexpected links requesting sensitive information  
- Unverified sender email addresses  
- Requests for login credentials  

---

## Phishing Prevention Methods

- User awareness and training  
- Verifying sender email addresses  
- Avoiding unknown or suspicious links  
- Using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  
- Email filtering and security solutions  
---

## Outcome

This project provided hands-on experience in phishing attack simulation, detection, and prevention. It enhanced understanding of social engineering attacks and highlighted the importance of cybersecurity awareness.
